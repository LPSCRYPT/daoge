# DAOGE - Alpha 0.1
dao for renDoge Peace Proposals

-- Founded on the Party-Appropriate Principles of Doge Consciousness and Decentralized Autonomy --

The DAOGE begins with an **Admin**. This Admin can add more Admins and **Users**.

Users must have at least a balance of 50,000 renDoge to create a **Proposal**.

Proposals can be *filtered* and *deleted* by Admins.

Future functionality can include:
> renDoge based shareholding
> the instantiation of a DAOGE treasury for funding proposals
> 'dot-mocracy' decision making methods for stakeholders to collectively direct funding 
> governance rights proportionate to involvement, where the people involved in are the ones with the most context and involvement, vetted by the community
